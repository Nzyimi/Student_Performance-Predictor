# Student_Performance-Predictor

This project demonstrates a **Student Performnce Prediction and Analysis** system built using Python in a Google Colab environment with linea regression . It applies data analysis and machine leaning to predict a student’s final score based on stdy-related metrics such as study hours, attendance, previous exam results, and assignments completed.

##  Project Overview

This project walks through the following :
1. **Data Loading and Exploration** – Load and inspect the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, duplicates, and data types.
3. **Visualization** – Visualize relationships between metrics using charts and plots.
4. **Model Building** – Use Linear Regression to predict final scores.
5. **Evaluation** – Measure model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² metrics.
6. **Prediction Tool** – Predict student performance interactively by entering input metrics.

##  Technologies Used

- **Python **
- **Google Colab **
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** for model training and evaluation

## Key Visualizations

- **Study Hours vs Final Score** — Shows the direct relationship between time studied and performance.
- **Distribution of Final Scores** — Displays how final scores are spread across students.
- **Pairplot of All Metrics** — Illustrates relationships among all input variables.



##  Interactive Prediction Tool

You can input your own values for study hours, attendance, and other metrics to get a predicted final score. Example usage:

Enter number of study hours: 10
Enter attendance percentage: 85
Enter previous exam score: 70
Enter number of assignments done: 8
Predicted Final Score: 75.3
